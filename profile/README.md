# The problem of induction
The problem of induction questions the justification for believing in universal statements derived from experience, particularly in empirical sciences. While many consider these universal statements to be true based on experience, the challenge arises because experiences only yield singular statements, making it unclear how these singular experiences can justify broader universal claims.

Those who claim that the truth of a universal statement stems from experience typically imply that the universal statement's truth relies on aggregating singular ones, each confirmed by experience. This perspective suggests that the universal statement is grounded in an inductive inference, as it is built upon a collection of singular truths validated through empirical evidence.

## The chain of reasoning leading to infinity:
A <i>principle of induction</i> might be a statement with the help of which we could put inductive inferences into a logically acceptable form.

1. If a purely logical principle of induction existed similar to a tautology or an analytic statement, the problem of induction would not exist. This is because all inductive inferences would then be considered purely logical or tautological transformations, resembling deductions in deductive logic. The presence of the problem of induction suggests that such a purely logical principle of induction does not exist.

2. Therefore, the principle of induction must be a synthetic statement—one whose negation is logically possible without self-contradiction. This prompts the question of why such a principle should be logically accepted and how its acceptance can be justified on rational grounds.

3. The principle of induction itself must also be a universal statement. Therefore, if we attempt to consider its truth as derived from experience, we'll encounter the same problem that led to its formulation in the first place.

4. To validate it, we'd need to use inductive inferences. Yet, to support these new 'meta-inductive' inference, we'd have to presuppose a higher-order inductive principle over and over again ad infinitum. Therefore, thought the philosophers of the past, trying to ground the principle of induction in experience fails, as it leads to an "endless" chain of reasoning — a "never-ending" regress.
